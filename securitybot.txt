Notice Regarding Our Security Bot Scans

If our security bot has scanned your site, it may be because someone has reported your domain to us for review. In such cases, we conduct additional security checks to investigate the issue further.

If you have not been reported and you prefer that your site not be scanned or probed in the future, please contact us at contact@globalstats.xyz or send a direct message on Discord (hbkvxncent) to request removal. We take these requests seriously and will promptly add your domain to our “do-not-scan” blacklist. Once blacklisted, your site will no longer be subject to future scans or probes from our security bot.

However, if your site has been flagged due to a security complaint, abuse report, or evidence of malicious activity, you may not be eligible to opt out until our investigation is complete. This policy helps maintain the safety of users, networks, and the broader internet community.

Our goal is to maintain a respectful and transparent security environment for all webmasters and site owners. We understand that some may not wish to participate in automated scanning, and we respect that choice whenever possible.

The security bot is designed to help improve the safety and integrity of online services by:

Identifying potential vulnerabilities or abuse patterns

Detecting unusual or suspicious activity

Alerting administrators to security risks

Supporting abuse mitigation efforts across the web

Privacy & Impact We do not collect personal data only publicly accessible information. Our scans are lightweight and will not disrupt your site’s performance. All data gathered is used solely for security purposes and is never sold or shared.

If you have any concerns about our scanning process, need further details, or would like to request a copy of our scan results, please reach out. Our team is available to provide clarifications and answer any questions.

Transparency and collaboration are central to our mission. We believe that working together with site owners helps create a safer and more trustworthy internet for all.
